            <b>History and etymology</b><br>
            The term was proposed in French ("géomatique") at the end of the 1960s by scientist Bernard
            Dubuisson to reflect at the time recent changes in the jobs of surveyor and photogrammetrist.
            The term was first employed in a French Ministry of Public Works memorandum dated 1 June
            1971 instituting a "standing committee of geomatics" in the government.<br>
            The term was popularised in English by French-Canadian surveyor Michel Paradis in his The little
            Geodesist that could article, in 1981 and in a keynote address at the centennial congress of the
            Canadian Institute of Surveying (now known as the Canadian Institute of Geomatics) in April 1982.
            He claimed that at the end of the 20th century the needs for geographical information would reach
            a scope without precedent in history and that, in order to address these needs, it was necessary
            to integrate in a new discipline both the traditional disciplines of land surveying and the new tools
            and techniques of data capture, manipulation, storage and diffusion.
            <br>
            Geomatics includes the tools and techniques used in land surveying, remote sensing, cartography,
            geographic information systems (GIS), global-navigation satellite systems (GPS, GLONASS,
            Galileo, Compass), photogrammetry, geophysics, geography, and related forms of earth mapping.
            The term was originally used in Canada but has since been adopted by the International
            Organization for Standardization, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, and many other
            international authorities, although some (especially in the United States) have shown a preference
            for the term geospatial technology,
         which may be defined as synonym of "geospatial
            information and communications technology".
            <br>
            Although many definitions of geomatics, such as the above, appear to encompass the entire
            discipline relating to geographic information – including geodesy, geographic information
            systems, remote sensing, satellite navigation, and cartography –, the term is almost exclusively
            restricted to the perspective of surveying and engineering toward geographic information.
            Geoinformatics has been proposed as an alternative comprehensive term, but its use is only
            common in some parts of the world, especially Europe.
            The related field of hydrogeomatics covers the area associated with surveying work carried out
            on, above or below the surface of the sea or other areas of water. The older term of hydrographics
            was considered too specific to the preparation of marine charts, and failed to include the broader
            concept of positioning or measurements in all marine environments.
            A growing number of university departments which were once titled "surveying", "survey
            engineering" or "topographic science" have re-titled themselves using the terms "geomatics" or
            "geomatics engineering", while others have switched to program titles such as "spatial information
            technology", and similar names.
            <br>
            The rapid progress and increased visibility of geomatics since the 1990s has been made
            possible by advances in computer hardware, computer science, and software engineering, as well
            as by airborne and space observation remote-sensing technologies.
            Geospatial science or spatial information science is an academic discipline incorporating
            fields such as surveying, geographic information systems, remote sensing, and cartography.
            Spatial science is typically concerned with the measurement, management, analysis and display
            of spatial information describing the Earth, its physical features and the design environment.
            The term spatial science or spatial sciences is primarily used in Australia.<b> Australian
            universities which offer degrees in spatial science include Curtin University,
            the University of
            Tasmania,
            
            the University of Adelaide,Melbourne University and RMIT University.
            <br>
            In the U.S., Texas A&M University offers a bachelor's degree in Spatial Sciences and is home to
            its own Spatial Sciences Laboratory.</b><br>
            Beginning in 2012, the University of Southern California
            started to place more emphasis on the spatial science branch of its geography department, with
            traditional human and physical geography courses and concentrations either not being offered on
            a regular basis or phased out. In place, the university now offers graduate programs strictly
            related to spatial science and its geography department offers a spatial science minor rather than
            the original geography major.
            <br>
            Spatial information practitioners within the Asia-Pacific region are represented by the
            professional body called the Surveying and Spatial Sciences Institute (SSSI).
            <br>
            Engineering<br>
            Geomatic(s) Engineering, Geodesy and Geoinformatics Engineering or Geospatial
            Engineering is a rapidly developing engineering discipline that focuses on spatial information
            (i.e. information that has a location). The location is the primary factor used to integrate a very
            wide range of data for spatial analysis and visualization. Geomatics engineers apply engineering
            principles to spatial information and implement relational data structures involving measurement
            sciences, thus using geomatics and acting as spatial information engineers. Geomatics engineers
            manage local, regional, national and global spatial data infrastructures.<i><b> Geomatics Engineering
            also involves aspects of Computer Engineering, Software Engineering and Civil Engineering.</i></b>
           <br> Science<br>
            Geomatics is a field that incorporates several others such as the older field of land surveying
            engineering along with many other aspects of spatial data management ranging from data science
            and cartography to geography. Following the advanced developments in digital data processing,
            the nature of the tasks required of the professional land surveyor has evolved significantly in
            recent years, and for more and more people the term "surveying" no longer accurately covers the
            whole range of tasks that the profession deals with. As our societies become more complex,
            information with a spatial position associated with it becomes more critical to decision-making,
            both from a personal and a business perspective, and also from a community and a large-scale
            governmental viewpoint.
            Therefore, the geomatics engineer can be involved in an extremely wide variety of information
            gathering activities and applications. Geomatics engineers design, develop, and operate systems
            for collecting and analyzing spatial information about the land, the oceans, natural resources, and
            manmade features.<br>
            The more traditional land surveying strand of geomatics engineering is concerned with the
            determination and recording of boundaries and areas of real property parcels, and the preparation
            and interpretation of legal land descriptions. The tasks more closely related to civil engineering
            include the design and layout of public infrastructure and urban subdivisions, and mapping and
            control surveys for construction projects.
            Geomatics engineers serve society by collecting, monitoring, archiving, and maintaining diverse
            spatial data infrastructures. Geomatics engineers utilize a wide range of technologically advanced
            tools such as digital theodolite/distance meter total stations, Global Positioning System (GPS)
            equipment, digital aerial imagery (both satellite and air-borne), and computer-based geographic
            information systems (GIS). These tools enable the geomatics engineer to gather, process,
            analyze, visualize and manage spatially related information to solve a wide range of technical and
            societal problems.<br>
            Geomatics engineering is the field of activity that integrates the acquisition, processing, analysis,
            display and management of spatial information. It is an exciting and new grouping of subjects in
            the spatial and environmental information sciences with a broad range of employment
            opportunities as well as offering challenging pure and applied research problems in a vast range
            of interdisciplinary fields.
            In different schools and in different countries the same education curriculum is administered with
            the name surveying in some, and in others with the names geomatics, civil engineering surveying,
            geomatics engineering, geospatial (information) engineering, surveying engineering, or geodesy
            and geoinformatics. While these occupations were at one time often taught in civil engineering
            education programs, more and more universities include the departments relevant for geo-data
            sciences under informatics, computer science or applied mathematics. These facts demonstrate
            the breadth, depth and scope of the highly interdisciplinary nature of geomatics engineering. The
            job of geospatial engineer is well established in the U.S. military.<br>
